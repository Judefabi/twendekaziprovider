  <h3 align="center">Twendekazi</h3>

  <p align="center">
    As part of my third-year project, we created the Twendekazi applications i.e., Twendekazi for users and Twendekazi for Service Providers using Flutter for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. The idea behind Twendekazi was to connect service providers like plumbers, househelps, Mama Fuas, etc. to homeowners, on the go, who needed these services within a short time. These applications used geolocation services to link homeowners to the nearest service providers matching their requirements thus cutting down on the time and effort it takes to acquire these day-to-day services. The aim was to present the users with a list of vetted service providers that could take these jobs thus easing the burden on homeowners and helping service providers get jobs all from the comfort of their houses. Upon completion, users were allowed to pay for the services through MPESA through the Daraja API integration or using their cards through Flutterwave integration.

## About The Project

![Screen Shot](images/screenshot.png)

As part of my third-year project, we created the Twendekazi applications i.e., Twendekazi for users and Twendekazi for Service Providers using Flutter for the frontend and Firebase for the backend. The idea behind Twendekazi was to connect service providers like plumbers, househelps, Mama Fuas, etc. to homeowners, on the go, who needed these services within a short time. These applications used geolocation services to link homeowners to the nearest service providers matching their requirements thus cutting down on the time and effort it takes to acquire these day-to-day services. The aim was to present the users with a list of vetted service providers that could take these jobs thus easing the burden on homeowners and helping service providers get jobs all from the comfort of their houses. Upon completion, users were allowed to pay for the services through MPESA through the Daraja API integration or using their cards through Flutterwave integration.
